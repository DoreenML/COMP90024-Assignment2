The data spans the reference period of June 2016 to June 2018 and is aggregated to 2011 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).<br/><br/>\n\nThe Victorian Family Violence Database is a repository for a range of different datasets relating to family violence clients and service use, extracted from the data holdings of a variety of government agencies.<br/><br/>\n\nThe rate of patients per 100,000 population is calculated using the count of events occurring within a LGA and the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) of that LGA. The rate is calculated using the following formula: <i>Rate per 100,000 = (Number of events/ERP count) x 100,000</i>. ERPs are based on populations provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).<br/><br/>\n\nFor further information about this dataset and related statistics, visit the data source:\n<a href=\"https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/family-violence-data-portal/explanatory-notes-definitions#Ambulance%20Victoria\" target=\"_blank\">Crime Statistics Australia</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.crimestatistics.vic.gov.au/family-violence-data-portal/family-violence-data-dashboard/ambulance-victoria\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.</li>\n<li>Data concerning family violence and sexual violence cannot easily be disaggregated.
