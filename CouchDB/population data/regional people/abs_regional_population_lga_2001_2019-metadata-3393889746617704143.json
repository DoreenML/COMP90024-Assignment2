The data is aggregated to the 2019 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Local Government Areas (LGA).\n<br><br>\n\nEstimated resident population (ERP) is the official estimate of the Australian population, which links people to a place of usual residence within Australia. Usual residence within Australia refers to that address at which the person has lived or intends to live for six months or more in a given reference year. For the 30 June reference date, this refers to the calendar year around it. Estimated resident population is based on Census counts by place of usual residence (excluding short-term overseas visitors in Australia), with an allowance for Census net undercount, to which are added the estimated number of Australian residents temporarily overseas at the time of the Census.\n<br><br>\n\nThis data is sourced from the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/2018-19\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics (Catalogue Number: 3218.0)</a>.\n<br><br>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/regional-population-methodology/2018-19#explanatory-notes\" target=\"_blank\">Explanatory Notes</a>.\n<br><br>\n\nNotes:\n<ul>\n<li>The estimates in this issue are final for 2001 to 2016, revised for 2017 and 2018, and preliminary for 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<br> AURIN has ingested this dataset in its GeoPackage format.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"lga_code_2019","type":"String","title":"LGA Code 2019","description":"Local Government Area (LGA) code for the 2019 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS)","isDimension":false},{"name":"geom","type":"Geometry","title":"Geometry","description":"geom","isDimension":false},{"name":"erp_2019","type":"Integer","title":"ERP 2019","description":"Estimated resident population (ERP) for 2019","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","spatial":{"bbox":[144.333634048,-38.502988016,145.878412014,-37.175098993]},"states":["2"]}}
